Design Journal for Introduction to Communication Design

Week 1
-------

On our first lecture of the module ‘Communication design’, I found it rather interesting, as it was about the actual history of design, which I think is a very important aspect to be learning as it will help inspire and guide me to be a better designer. Throughout the lecture a vast amount was covered of what we would be doing in forthcoming weeks.

We studied various designers such as; Dieter Rams and Jonathan Ive. Both designers were inspired by the past and they used it to define their impending projects. Dieter Rams is a German industrial designer who was popular midst the 1950’s. He believed that less is more when it came to design, which I completely agree with his statement as the most iconic products out there have a very simplistic design. If he hadn’t come across the Ulm School of design he would have never fashioned such a simplistic and iconic design for Braun Radio. Jonathan Ive, the designer for the first  iMac, iPod and present Apple products hadn’t known about Dieter Rams he wouldn’t have been able to come up with such designs that we all know today. I find their work truly impeccable as it is so simplistic, which makes the products so easily understood and has made them so well known worldwide.

Week 2
-------

During this week’s lecture a vast amount of content was covered. When I walked out of the lecture I felt as if my brain was overflowing with new knowledge about these topics. The subjects of the lecture this week was about the historical Cave Paintings of our prehistoric selves, the golden ratio, illuminated manuscripts, and how modern day artists were inspired by previous artists work. I had very little understanding and knowledge about most of these topics so it was all new to me. 

####ALBUM COVERS
This morning’s lecture initiated by looking at album covers that had been influenced by old artwork. One of them was the Chemical Brothers album ‘We Are the Night’ which was released in 2007; it’s album artwork was very similar to the piece Lonely Politician by the artist named Herbert Bayer in 1932.

Another example of this is the classic work of art by the Japanese artist Hosukai which is a woodblock print which was created between 1830 - 1833 and the album artwork by the band Keane which was released in 2006, It is pretty obvious that the album artwork was inspired by the Japanese art, as the horses correspond with the shape of the waves.

####CAVE PAINTINGS
Stick-figured paintings of animals to stencilled outlines of hands, cave paintings and illustrations found within cave walls and ceilings.  The earliest known cave painting was found approximately 40,000 years ago; which dated back to the Aurignacian period which was found in Spain in the El Castillo Cave in Cantabria. It is still unknown to us why these cave paintings where created, but I figured it was to capture their memories and experiences, also that it is suggested that they were a way of communicating to others who visited the caves and for religious and ceremonial occasions.


####THE REOCCURRING THEME
The cave paintings have a similar reoccurrence of animal paintings, such as; horses, bison and deer. They also consist of hand stencils made by blowing pigment on a hand that is held against the wall. As well as the more obvious paintings, they used a more abstract technique called Finger fluting, which are lines that fingers leave on a soft surface such as clay or moonmilk. The earliest cave paintings were made up of red dots on the cave walls, which is possibly one of the earliest cases of pointillism. The dots were produced by covering the right palm with wet red ochre and pressing it against the wall, this relates to the design fundamental “point” which we had been learning this week. “Earth pigments” used in cave paintings consisted of the red and yellow ochre, hematite, manganese oxide and charcoal.


####PAINTING TECHNIQUES
Tools were created and used to help create the paintings, such as; the use of horse hair to create a brush to apply paint to the walls, twigs to make linear marks and feathers to blend colours. A blinding material such as saliva or fat was used to trap pigment into the porous wall, so once it dried it was stuck which kept the cave paintings intact. Other methods of applying the pigment were by blowing, dabbing and smearing onto the cave wall.

####CAVE PAINTINGS AND PICASSO

>"We have learned nothing in twelve thousand years."

Pablo Picasso was inspired and influenced by Cave Paintings to create the outstanding piece “Guernica” as you can see that he has used similar styles and abstract forms. Picasso came across the striking paintings in a cave in south-western France that dated way back to the Ice Age. He was so fascinated by the painting that he used the style in his work

####MODERN DAY PAINTERS
Graffiti is a modern day equivalent to the thousands of years old cave paintings. One of the most well-known graffiti artists is a British artist by the name of Banksy. Also being an artist he is a political activist which brings attention to his work as he displays this in cunning ways for the world to see. One of his most recent works of art was a Mural that had been painted overnight in Clacton-on-Sea, a week away from a parliamentary byelection. It removed has it was seen as offensive and racist.

####THE GOLDEN RATIO

#####1.61803398875

The golden ratio was another topic that was covered during this week’s lecture, something that I had very little knowledge about. I didn’t know how much the golden ratio was used within the design world; for example in the shapes of postcards, posters, wide-screen televisions, photographs.
Within design and art work The Golden Ratio is used to produce aesthetically pleasing, natural looking compositions. It is a mathematical rule that has been used for at least 4,000 years. The Golden ratio is a common sight in nature, such as the centre of a flower which is subject to the Fibonacci sequence; the seeds start from the centre and spread outwards. Pine cones are also arranges in the similar spiral pattern. Shells and fossils are also a natural matter that follows the golden ratio; which takes on the form of the logarithmic spiral. The golden Ratio, Also known as the Golden Mean, The Golden Section and also the Greek letter of Phi, the golden rule describes the relationship between two proportions. The golden ratio follows a 1:1:61 ratio which when used results in art and design work that appears entirely in proportion.

####EXAMPLES OF GOLDEN RATIO USE
Twitter redesigned their logo In 2010, Twitter’s creative director Doug Bowman posted this screen grab on its Flickr page to explain how the company used the golden ratio in its redesign. 

>"To anyone curious about #NewTwitter proportions, know that we didn't leave those ratios to chance,"

####STEFEN SAGMEISTER
Stefen Sagmeiter, the eccentric designer created a logo for the Seed Media Group. In which the used the golden ratio and elements of nature (phyllotaxis) to create a simplistic yet complicated logo. By using different colours he created different variations of the logo, such as portraits for employee’s business cards. As this week I was focusing on the design fundamental point, I was very captivated by his work.
