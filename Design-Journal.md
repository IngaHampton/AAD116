Design Journal for Introduction to Communication Design

Week 1
-------

On our first lecture of the module ‘Communication design’, I found it rather interesting, as it was about the actual history of design, which I think is a very important aspect to be learning as it will help inspire and guide me to be a better designer. Throughout the lecture a vast amount was covered of what we would be doing in forthcoming weeks.

We studied various designers such as; [Dieter Rams] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieter_Rams) and [Jonathan Ive] (https://www.apple.com/uk/pr/bios/jonathan-ive.html). Both designers were inspired by the past and they used it to define their impending projects. Dieter Rams is a German industrial designer who was popular midst the 1950’s. He believed that less is more when it came to design, which I completely agree with his statement as the most iconic products out there have a very simplistic design. If he hadn’t come across the [Ulm School of design] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulm_School_of_Design) he would have never fashioned such a simplistic and iconic design for Braun Radio. Jonathan Ive, the designer for the first  iMac, iPod and present [Apple](https://www.apple.com/uk/) products hadn’t known about Dieter Rams he wouldn’t have been able to come up with such designs that we all know today. I find their work truly impeccable as it is so simplistic, which makes the products so easily understood and has made them so well known worldwide.

> "I believe designers should eliminate the unnecessary. That means eliminating everything that is modish because this kind of thing is only short-lived." - Deiter Rams

####MARKDOWN

During the first week of the course we were introduced to the basics of two essential tools used for the interaction design world; [Atom] (https://atom.io/) and [Markdown] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).  Atom is a free text editor created by Github used to code such languages as Markdown. Markdown was easy enough to understand, which was pretty good as I am new coding. We were given a project to familiarise ourselves with the program. We had the task to change some text into markdown to match a PDF document.

PDF file we were given:

![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/5GDPfc3.jpg)

I wanted to look into and comprehend Markdown a little better before starting this project. I learnt some of the fundamentals by going onto [GitHub Markdown basics](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/) , which made it pretty easy to understand. I also used this ‘Markdown’ syntax sheet to help me understand it better.

![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/l8r5hgG.jpg)

I also researched why is it better people use Markdown for their work, I found this blog on [life hacker](http://lifehacker.com/5943320/what-is-markdown-and-why-is-it-better-for-my-to-do-lists-and-notes) which was pretty interesting.

This is a screen shot of my code and markdown preview on Atom after I converted the text, I rendered the plain text into, headings, emboldened text, italicised text, and listed.

I could not get it to be identical to the PDF file as that would require CSS, which I have not learnt as of yet. This is my final outcome:

##IRELAND'S RUGGED COAST YIELDS
#Priceless Relics of the Spanish Armada
## by ROBERT STÉNUIT

###*Illustrations by National Geographic*

###*Photographer Bates Lilttlehales*

A WILD NORTH WIND lashed the galleass as she sailed eastward across the top of Ireland. A monstrous wave had smashed her jury rudder; now she yawed and rolled in the troughs, making relentless leeway toward night-hidden cliffs to starboard.

>##“In 1588 a ship of the Spanish Armada, the *Girona* was wrecked with the loss of almost all her company at a little cove near the *Giants Causeway* still called *Port na Spaniagh*, ‘the port of the Spaniards’.”

Ahead, not thirty miles away, lay Scotland's west coast and sanctuary for the vessels company, survivors
of Spain's once arrogant Armada. A few more miles and the *Girona* would be clear of Ireland; a few more
hours would make good an escape begun nearly three months before. Oarsmen battled the wind with flailing
sweeps, struggling vainly to steer the ship away from the shore.

The wind won. White water boiled off the starboard bow. A scream from the lookout brought sailors racing
to drop anchor. Too late. A fang of rock rising from the sea ripped the *Girona's* flank; she gutted herself upon
it. Her back broke, her side opened, her entrails burst from her. Cannons, cannon balls, small arms, stores,
coffers and 1,300 sick men, too exhausted to struggle, sank into the convulsive surf.

**Four centuries later the shipwreck was discovered under 30 feet of icy water, treasures lost on that fateful
day included:**

* A ornamental winged salamander
* Gold cross of the Knight of Malta
* Gilded brass dolphin
* Lapis lazuli cameos
* Silver sculpture of a grotesque face.
* Gold ducats

**The Author:** Veteran Belgin dicer Robert Sténuit spent two days at 432 feet beneath the sea in a pioneering test he
described in **“The Deepest Days”**, NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC, April 1965. Here he tells the dramatic story of finding
the Girona.

Overall I found the Atom text editor very easy to use and understand, Also that it was so simple and quick to render the text into markdown.

Week 2
-------

During this week’s lecture a vast amount of content was covered. When I walked out of the lecture I felt as if my brain was overflowing with new knowledge about these topics. The subjects of the lecture this week was about the historical [Cave Paintings] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_painting) of our prehistoric selves, the [golden ratio] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio), [illuminated manuscripts] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illuminated_manuscript), and how modern day artists were inspired by previous artists work. I had very little understanding and knowledge about most of these topics, so it was all new to me.

####ALBUM COVERS
This morning’s lecture initiated by looking at album covers that had been influenced by old artwork. One of them was the [Chemical Brothers] (http://www.thechemicalbrothers.com/#p=home) album ‘We Are the Night’ which was released in 2007; it’s album artwork was very similar to the piece Lonely Politician by the artist named [Herbert Bayer] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Bayer) in 1932.

![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/qAtJC2k.jpg)

Another example of this is the classic work of art by the Japanese artist Hosukai and the painting called 'The Great Wave off Kanagawa' which is a woodblock print which was created between 1830 - 1833 and the album artwork by the band Keane which was released in 2006, It is pretty obvious that the album artwork was inspired by the Japanese art, as the horses correspond with the shape of the waves.

![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/GEQpgIW.jpg)

####CAVE PAINTINGS
Stick-figured paintings of animals to stencilled outlines of hands, cave paintings and illustrations found within cave walls and ceilings.  The earliest known cave painting was found approximately 40,000 years ago; which dated back to the Aurignacian period which was found in Spain in the [El Castillo Cave] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_of_El_Castillo) in Cantabria. It is still unknown to us why these cave paintings where created, but I figured it was to capture their memories and experiences, also that it is suggested that they were a way of communicating to others who visited the caves and for religious and ceremonial occasions.


####THE REOCCURRING THEME
The cave paintings have a similar reoccurrence of animal paintings, such as; horses, bison and deer. They also consist of hand stencils made by blowing pigment on a hand that is held against the wall. As well as the more obvious paintings, they used a more abstract technique called Finger fluting, which are lines that fingers leave on a soft surface such as clay or moonmilk. The earliest cave paintings were made up of red dots on the cave walls, which is possibly one of the earliest cases of pointillism. The dots were produced by covering the right palm with wet red ochre and pressing it against the wall, this relates to the design fundamental “point” which we had been learning this week. “Earth pigments” used in cave paintings consisted of the red and yellow ochre, hematite, manganese oxide and charcoal.


####PAINTING TECHNIQUES
Tools were created and used to help create the paintings, such as; the use of horse hair to create a brush to apply paint to the walls, twigs to make linear marks and feathers to blend colours. A blinding material such as saliva or fat was used to trap pigment into the porous wall, so once it dried it was stuck which kept the cave paintings intact. Other methods of applying the pigment were by blowing, dabbing and smearing onto the cave wall.

####CAVE PAINTINGS AND PICASSO

>"We have learned nothing in twelve thousand years."

[Pablo Picasso] (http://www.pablopicasso.org/) was inspired and influenced by Cave Paintings to create the outstanding piece “Guernica” as you can see that he has used similar styles and abstract forms. Picasso came across the striking paintings in a cave in south-western France that dated way back to the Ice Age. He was so fascinated by the painting that he used the style in his work

![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/POLfb7C.jpg)

####MODERN DAY PAINTERS
Graffiti is a modern day equivalent to the thousands of years old cave paintings. One of the most well-known graffiti artists is a British artist by the name of Banksy. Also being an artist he is a political activist which brings attention to his work as he displays this in cunning ways for the world to see. One of his most recent works of art was a Mural that had been painted overnight in Clacton-on-Sea, a week away from a parliamentary byelection. It removed has it was seen as offensive and racist.

####THE GOLDEN RATIO

#####1.61803398875

The golden ratio was another topic that was covered during this week’s lecture, something that I had very little knowledge about. I didn’t know how much the golden ratio was used within the design world; for example in the shapes of postcards, posters, wide-screen televisions, photographs.
Within design and art work The Golden Ratio is used to produce aesthetically pleasing, natural looking compositions. It is a mathematical rule that has been used for at least 4,000 years. The Golden ratio is a common sight in nature, such as the centre of a flower which is subject to the [Fibonacci sequence] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number); the seeds start from the centre and spread outwards. Pine cones are also arranges in the similar spiral pattern. Shells and fossils are also a natural matter that follows the golden ratio; which takes on the form of the logarithmic spiral. The golden Ratio, Also known as the Golden Mean, The Golden Section and also the Greek letter of Phi, the golden rule describes the relationship between two proportions. The golden ratio follows a 1:1:61 ratio which when used results in art and design work that appears entirely in proportion.

![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/Luewqek.jpg)

####EXAMPLES OF GOLDEN RATIO USE
[Twitter] (https://twitter.com/) redesigned their logo In 2010, Twitter’s creative director [Doug Bowman] (http://stopdesign.com/) posted this screen grab on its Flickr page to explain how the company used the golden ratio in its redesign.

>"To anyone curious about #NewTwitter proportions, know that we didn't leave those ratios to chance,"

![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/JjbsVOk.jpg)

####STEFEN SAGMEISTER
[Stefen Sagmeiter] (http://www.sagmeisterwalsh.com/), the eccentric designer created a logo for the Seed Media Group. In which the used the golden ratio and elements of nature (phyllotaxis) to create a simplistic yet complicated logo. By using different colours he created different variations of the logo, such as portraits for employee’s business cards. As this week I was focusing on the design fundamental point, I was very captivated by his work.

![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/34FVBBv.jpg)

####THE DEVEOPMENT OF WRITING AND THE BOOK OF KELLS
The development of writing forms originated from just being a pictorial, The Egyptians where the starting point, as they used pictorials to communicate, for example; the simple drawing of an eye associates to the letter ’O’ and over the years it has simplified down. Most letters in our alphabet today originated this way. Writing was first scribed onto stone tablets, but as writing developed, people started to use papyrus, as it was more durable and not as laborious.

The Book of Kells named after Kells Abbey in County Meath, Ireland. It is an elaborately illustrated manuscript that was created by the Celtic Monks approximately AD 800. The books production was a meticulous and slow process to duplicate as it was all done by hand.

####What I found this week:

####GITHUB
GitHub is a Git repository web-based hosting service; it basically is a social network for programmers. GitHub was initiated by Linus Trovolds, the creator of Linux. On Github Your work can be public for the world to see, and you can also collaborate with people and their uploads! The great thing about GitHub is that; it manages and stores a record of all the modifications that you have made, which is handy if something is accidently removed or changed, as you can just go back to what you had worked on beforehand. Getting GitHub up and running was quite confusing and intimidating at the start, then Tim helped explain all the ins and outs of the onine repository and it’s vocabulary, such as ‘repo’, ’forking’, ’pull’ and ‘push’. We created new accounts after learning some of the basics, and forked Tim’s ‘Hello World’ page from his account so we could modify it to create our own versions of the page.

I have been trying to educate myself html in my spare time, as I was completely new to it when joining this course, so I kind of understood what I was undertaking. The first thing we changed was our avatars, we simply done that by copy and pasting our Twitter profile image links into the index file. The next step was to link up our social media sits and GitHub pages to the icons Tim already constructed for us, all we had to do is add in the links.

####RESEARCHING AND MY PAGE

Before writing about ourselves for our pages, we had to research the self-promotion of other designers and their blogs and websites, by reading the ‘about me’ section and see how they pitched themselves to the world. As it is very important that I set myself out to be someone who I think people would enjoy reading about, as these first few paragraphs will create the first opinions people will be judging me on.

####CRAIG MOD

One of the designers I researched was [Craig Mod] (http://craigmod.com/about/), I loved how he wrote his ‘About me’, as he comes across as informal and humble, I think this impression makes the viewer feel comfortable and relatable to him. I also like how he has put a short and simple piece of text at the top of the page as it grabs the reader’s attention, and then if you want to go more into detail about him, he has more information about himself below.

![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/IGVWX9l.jpg)

####JESSICA HISCHE

Jessica Hische is an inspirational typographer and graphic designer. Jessica's about section is a long page with a large quantity of text that consists of links to her work and other relating sites to her information. I like how she has titled her about section, as she has made it humorous and relatable. I also like how she has came across as friendly by saying “who I am, what I do, and why we should be friends”

![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/wNRBUeW.jpg)

####MY 'ABOUT ME'

When writing about myself on my page, I found it quite difficult and didn't know where to start. I wanted to keep it short and simple but also friendly and upbeat.

#HELLO THERE, I'M INGA HAMPTON

##I’m a first year Interaction Design Student, Belfast.

I currently study at the **University of Ulster**. I have a great interest in most aspects of Creative Arts; Graphical Art, Music, Traditional Art, Photography. I enjoy creating wallpapers and typography. I am greatly inspired by the works of **Josef Müller-Brockmann** and **Stefan Sagmeister**.

In my spare time, I enjoy a good book and game. I also like to draw and listen to a wide range of music. When I can, I love to go to concerts, watch comedy, travel… and the list goes on!

Keep an eye out, as I shall be blogging very soon,sharing my thoughts and designs with you! But in the meantime check out some of my graphic work on **Flickr**, or tweet me by clicking on the Icons below!

Week 3
-------
####GUTTENBERG AND MOVEABLE TYPE

This week’s lecture was about the massive impact [printing press] (http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/lang_gallery_05.shtml) has had in the evolution and design of typography. We went through a vast amount of fonts and the typographers that created or improved them.

Sites that we were recommended to look at:

-	[Nice Web Type] (http://nicewebtype.com/)
-	[Hellohappy.org] (http://hellohappy.org/)
-	[Type cast] (http://typecast.com/)


We were also told to look at A List Apart's article on Typography & Web Fonts and The League of Moveable Type's blog, which were both pretty interesting.
The industrialisation of the first ‘Moveable Type’ was originated and established in China by the printer Bi Sheng between 1041 and 1048. German printer [Johannes Gutenberg] (http://www.biography.com/people/johannes-gutenberg-9323828) in 1450, created the first ever westernised printing press. Books were quicker and less expensive to print so they could be mass produced which made it more accessible to people of all classes.

‘The Gutenburg Bible’ was the first ever book to be printed using Moveable Type

So after looking more into typography I created some fonts, I first created them by hand on squared paper, I then created the font on ‘FontStruct’. I based my fonts on Point, Line, and Plane.

####What I found this week:

####CHANGING THE BACKGROUND

During Tim's class we learnt how to change out backgrounds for our own pages by linking them in from flickr. I used a Photo I had taken and edited in illustrator. I think it looks pretty good so far!

####IXD PROJECT 02 – GROUP PRESENTATION

- 16/10/14 - Group library meeting

Week 4
-------

####A Century of Change
The industrial revolution and how it changed and formed a new age of art and design was the subject we covered throughout this week’s lecture; this mass industrialisation around the 1900’s, pushed humanity to transition from rural to urban lives, causing the revolution which brought the introduction of machines, mass production, and new technology such as; radio transmissions, the motor vehicle, flight, the electric light bulb, photography and moving pictures. This all resulted in not only a change in people’s everyday lives, but the artwork which they created. The increasing demand for materials resulted in poor quality and effortless production, which pushed artists and designers to respond negatively against industrialisation.

The five art movements that affected during this industrialisation period were; Japonism, Arts & Crafts, The Glasgow School, Art Nouveau and Vienna Secession. Before this lecture I didn’t actually know how much these movements had an impact on art and design; as characteristics of the movements can still be seen in many things that around today.

####Japonism
Japanese arts and crafts arrived into Europe around the 1850’s, this influence of Europe art became known as Japonisme. Japanese wood-block prints became a massive source of inspiration for a lot of European impressionist painters because of its bold strong colours; with flattened and lacking perspectives and shadow this attracted many artists such as Edouard Manet, Claude Monet, Edgar Degas, Vincent Van Gogh, Paul Cezanne and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. These Artists traversed many of the characteristics of the movement from painting to sculpture, architecture and design. Japonism would be one of my favourite movements as I like the simplicity and bold colours.

![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/cF9JYfb.jpg)

####Arts and Crafts Movement
Revolting against the industrialisation, the Arts and Crafts movement had developed; it reacted against the industrial and machine based production. The movement correlated with nature, it had simple forms with little ornamentation. The movement flourished between 1860 and 1910, it was inspired by socialist principles and led by William Morris. Recognized for his textile work, William Morris was also an Artist, illustrator, author, typographer, printer, bookbinder and medievalist. I do like this art movement, but it is tad too florally for me.

![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/YJcy6qq.jpg)

####Photography and Moving Image
Around 1826 the earliest known surviving photograph was taken by Joseph Niépce, the photo was captured on a printing plate by using a camera obscura. The photograph ‘View from the Window at le Gras’ portrays the view from an upstairs window at Niépce’s estate in France. Photography transitioned to the creation of moving images. One of the first ever moving images was created by Edward Muybridge, ‘The Horse in Motion’ was created to prove a statement that when a horse gallops, does it become airborne. It was created by a series of photographs featuring a galloping racehorse, fifty cameras were aligned along the racetrack, each camera linked up to trip wires, as the horse ran past, the string broke and an image was captured.

####Github

This week during class tim went through how we could install and use github desktop, as it is a far easier and reliable process, all we needed to do was save our work that we had done on atom and push it.

(to be continued)

Week 5

####Dada and Propaganda in Design



####What I found this week:

##The Presentation


This week we were given the task of researching and creating a presentation within a selected group of four; this involved our groups to prepare a 10 minute presentation that would be in front of our class and lectures.

My group were given the task of researching the ‘Pioneers of digital design’, so the first thing we had set out to do was a group meeting to organise and assign rolls and time.

####First group meeting - 16/10/14 - Library room

At the start of our first group meeting we hadn’t a clue where to start, so we first researched, ‘what is digital design?’ as we had to understand the true meaning before delving into the pioneers who initiated it. We also had to figure out the structure of the information for our presentation, so we divided the time, for each person; we all had 2 and a half minutes to talk about our selected area. We came up with a basic layout of the information for the presentation:

For section one, I thought, as we didn’t really understand what digital design really consisted of, that the presentation needed to start with a basic overview of what it was. I then thought that we needed to discuss what tools people use to create digital design work, like how they transitioned from the first mac to the fantastic software that we are provided with now.

For section two as a group we thought that we needed to find the main pioneers who we thought really helped push the digital design development. So for whoever chose to do that section had to research and find two artist that they thought would fit in well to the presentation.

Section two consisted of two more artists that helped digital design evolve, but they needed to relate well with the previous two pioneers so it would be a journey for the audience, so it could be easily followed.

For section three, the tools that they used needed to be discussed. Also a pioneer of today, maybe one that hasn’t maybe followed the others footsteps, and went in another direction. So for the person who chose to do this roll they needed to find someone who they thought fitted well for this title. They would also have to summarize the presentation at the end to insure the audience has understood the presentation the correctly and reinforce key points made throughout.


**Section 1**
- Introduction
- List of what we will discuss
- What is digital design?
- How the technology has changed things.

**Section 2**
- Pioneer of digital design
- Pioneer of digital design

**Section 3**
- Pioneer of digital design
- Pioneer of digital design

**Section 4**
- The tools they used
- Pioneer of today
- Summary

We then assigned rolls so we could start gathering information for each section.
As team it was decided who should take on a section of the presentation, I chose to take on the first part, which consisted of the introduction, explaining what we would discuss, what was digital design, and the tools they used. We also set up a group chat using Facebook so we could contact each other.


##Research

####What is digital design?

Once I had the titles of my section I needed to find information to fill them, I started by searching online ‘what is digital design?’ and see where it would take me. I stumbled upon a few websites that told me the information I needed for the brief overview.

**Websites**
- [soyouwana.com](http://www.soyouwanna.com/digital-design-1063.html)
- [degreedirectory.org](http://degreedirectory.org/articles/What_is_a_Digital_Designer.html)
- [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_design)
- [Inkling](https://www.inkling.com/read/history-of-graphic-design-philip-meggs-5th/chapter-24/pioneers-of-digital-graphic)

**Books**
-	Meggs’ History of Graphic Design – Pioneers of digital graphic design.

I had learnt that digital design is seen everywhere, everything from web design and animation, to the special effects that are used in movies. Also it is needed for architectural planning and computer-aided manufacturing. Digital designers use their creative knowledge and adept computer abilities to design visuals that are used within such technology; computers, phones, interactive screens.

####How to introduce a presentation


One thing I was really worried about, was talking in front of an audience. Even though it was our class it was still quite daunting, especially because I had to introduce our group and start of the presentation, so I searched ways to execute a presentation. These were some of the things that came up:

- [Presentation structuring](http://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/ld/resources/presentation/structuring-presentation)
- [Dummies.com](http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/how-to-write-an-introduction-for-a-presentation.html)
- [Englishclub.com](https://www.englishclub.com/speaking/presentations-pres.htm)

####How technology changed our ways

For this slide I had to research the change in the equipment that digital designers use, such as the Macintosh. Without these tools designers wouldn’t have been able to create as elaborate work as they would by hand, so as computers improved over time, the graphics had advanced so designers were able to create much more complicated work.

Throughout my research I found out that Macintosh really helped this development, as before they were invented people were not able to use typography as creatively.  Macintosh was one of the first computers that had icons, Icons are seen everywhere today thanks to Macintosh.



####Group meeting two - 20/10/14 - Library room

We created a DropBox account so we could transfer and share information that we had gathered amongst ourselves. We discussed what we had found between the time that we had our last meeting, and any new ideas.


####Group meeting Three - 24/10/14 - Library room

We arranged another meeting to gather up all the information that we had researched to come up with so we could start making the presentation, we had trouble with coming up with designers that really helped push the development of digital design, so we discussed as a group some designers we had in mind and I sketched up what artists we should do and how they should link with each other, I presented my drawn plan to my group and they agreed to follow it, so we finally came up with something that really stuck and flowed well, here is my plan and the designers names.

![plan2](/images/plan 2.jpg)

- John Whitney
- Zuzana Licko
- April Greiman
- Joshua Davis

####Plan

Before creating the presentation, we needed to draw how it was going to plan out, so I set to drawing a plan using all the information we gathered.

![plan](/images/plan.jpg)

####Creating the Presentation on keynote

I took on the roll of creating the slides for the presentation, this was going to be interesting as it was my first time using keynote as I had invested on a new MacBook, and before I had only created slides on PowerPoint.

I wanted our presentation to stand out, and the first thing I knew about slide making is that people need visuals to understand what you are trying to present to them, also don’t bombard people with a slide full text and by keeping it short and eye catching, also a little humour can help.

####Typography

Typography is an important aspect when creating slides, and it can really make or break it. Using too many fonts will make it messy and difficult understand, or too little will make it plain and boring. So I chose nine fonts that I thought went well together:

- Frente H1
- Press Style
- Lobster 1.3
- Impact Label
- Andale Mono
- Brush Script MT
- Courier New
- Antonio
- Pacifico

I didn’t use more that 2-3 font per slide as it would make it look messy, some fonts I used as title pages so people would recognise when you had moved onto a new subject.

####Colours

Throughout the slides I used muted colours, I mainly had a black background to my slides and having the main titles in yellow; yellow being the most visible colour, it grabs the attention of the audience’s eye. I used it in a small amount to draw notice to the titles, as too much can be overpowering. For some title pages such as the last slide, I used a subtle green/teal colour, as green is well known for being calming, so I thought it was a good colour to end the presentation on. Overall I had a sepia theme throughout the slides of the presentation.

![colours](/images/colours.jpg)

####Illustrations

To explain what I was discussing in the presentation, I thought that some illustrations were needed; such as on the ‘technology changed our ways’ slide

![illustrations](/images/illustrations.jpg) ![words](/images/words.jpg)

####Humour

On two of the slides I used light humour, as it would make people feel more comfortable throughout the presentation.

####Slide line

I added a slide line to every slide to indicate what section that was on to keep both the audience and my group on track.

![lines](/images/lines.jpg)

####The information

Using DropBox my group members transferred their researched information to me so I could put it into the slides.


After creating the keynote slideshow, I posted it up on DropBox for my group to see and so they could add any additional information to it and notes, also so they see if they liked it or not and if they wanted any changes made on they way it looked, but everyone was happy with the theme.

####Rehearsing the presentation - 28/10/14 - 31/10/14

Also rehearsing our own lines, we needed to practise as a group, for time reasons and also to see how everyone was coping with what they had to say and nerves, we had met up three times to rehearse, once in the library, class room, and before the presentation. They first time we had rehearsed we all had spoken under our 10 minute time frame, we figured this was because we were all talking to quickly, so we had to focus more on our pacing.
